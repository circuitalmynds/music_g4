Le roi Lear (English: King Lear), Opus 4. Composed in Nice in 1831 during Berlioz's journey back to France after his stay in Italy (as a result of winning the Prix de Rome). The overture is based on Shakespeare's King Lear, a recent discovery for the composer whose love of the dramatist is evident in many other of his works. It was first performed at the Paris Conservatoire on 22 December 1833.
