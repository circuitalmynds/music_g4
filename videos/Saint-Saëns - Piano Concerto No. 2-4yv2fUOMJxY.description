A unique coupling of Romantic-era transcriptions, and a fine showcase for the artistry of an Azeri pianist with a limpid touch and powerful intelligence at the keyboard.

Composer: Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns
Artist: Maria Stembolskaya (piano)

In the centenary of his death in 1921, Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns is still patronised in some quarters as a prodigiously fluent musician of second-rate gifts. Yet his elders, his contemporaries and his students all esteemed him as an innovator as well as a gifted melodist and supremely disciplined technician in the craft as well as the art of composing. For Berlioz, the only problem with the child prodigy Saint-SaÃ«ns was that he knew too much. Ravel declared that he learnt everything he knew about orchestration from scores such as the Second Piano Concerto.

Out of the composerâ€™s five piano concertos, the Second has long established itself as the most popular thanks to a unique and winning stylistic progression neatly summed up â€˜from Bach to Offenbachâ€™, opening with a monumental cadenza and orchestral response in the manner of a Bachian prelude for organ, and winding up with an exhilarating tarantella.
Three years after its composition in 1868, a version for solo piano was made by none other than Georges Bizet, Saint-SaÃ«nsâ€™s short-lived contemporary. The arrangement was enthusiastically taken up by the composer, and it sheds valuable light on the essentially pianistic nature of his inspiration (after all, Saint-SaÃ«ns could play all of Beethovenâ€™s sonatas from memory by the age of nine).

This rarely encountered but fascinating transcription is complemented by â€˜Mon coeur s'ouvre Ã  ta voixâ€™, the love-confession sung by Delila in the grand Biblical epic staging the downfall of Samson, in a solo piano version made by the Russian musicologist Boris Borodin. Another of the composerâ€™s greatest admirers was Tchaikovsky, and Maria Stembolskaya adds a pair of piano fantasies inspired by the best-known of his stage works, Eugene Onegin: a free transcription of the third-act Polonaise made by Liszt, and a spectacular paraphrase of the operaâ€™s main themes by one of his most talented students, Paul Pabst.

Maria Stembolskaya's playing lends these transcriptions a scale and magnificence worthy of their originals. The intensity of her performances and the variety of her colouristic inflection evokes a powerful sense of the piano as an orchestra in its own right.
